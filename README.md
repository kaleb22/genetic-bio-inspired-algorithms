# genetic-bio-inspired-algorithms
A repo with two algorithms implementation. A genectic algorithm and a bio-inspired algorithm ( ACO ) applied to the problem of p-median capacitated.

# Test cases

the test cases that were used in this implementation are available in the link below.

The class that loads the file is the BaseDados.
Obs: in this implementation, I'm not using the fixed cost information.
